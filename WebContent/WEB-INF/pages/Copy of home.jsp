<div class="desc">
	<p>Mortgage calculators are automated tools that enable users to
		determine the financial implications of changes in one or more
		variables in a mortgage financing arrangement. Mortgage calculators
		are used by consumers to determine monthly repayments, and by mortgage
		providers to determine the financial suitability of a home loan
		applicant. 
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p>
		The major variables in a mortgage calculation include loan
		principal, balance, periodic compound interest rate, number of
		payments per year, total number of payments and the regular payment
		amount. More complex calculators can take into account other costs
		associated with a mortgage, such as local and state taxes, and
		insurance.
